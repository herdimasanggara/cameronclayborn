    <div class="bodytext">I recently went to Boston for the first time. It also being the first time I paid for and stayed in my own hotel room. Each of these occasions are congruent in the way that, one: I was in a place that I had never been to
      before, and two: In a short term private place that I had paid for. Boston, Massachusetts in my consciousness, and perhaps to a greater understanding within the US, is the location of the prim and proper, a location where majority of its
      population are white, a location of highly elite educational institutions, and a site of conception for ideals that continue to govern the modern United States. In short, this place being "Boston" made me aware of myself within it. A feeling
      that made me aware of my exterior - brown skin, presumably male, twenty-six years old, five foot ten, one hundred forty-five pounds, short black hair, dark eyes, wearing slim fit blue jeans, a black and white plaid shirt with a plain white
      t-shirt underneath, all white high top Vans, and a Carhartt coat with a black panther patch covering the Carhartt logo. That is what I looked like and that is what I was wearing when the front desk hotel attendant looked at me. In my head I was
      thinking; will they think I stole the card used to pay for the room? Will the people also checking in look at me as if I don't belong there? My questions were met with reality when not a single one of those things happened, quite the opposite
      actually. I walked in and was met with a smile of someone also checking in, and the attendant was very kind and made me laugh. I got in late, so didn't go out exploring. I enjoyed the amenities of the room, relishing mainly in its privacy. I
      downloaded "Grindr", a notable gay hook up app, to find that the majority of the profiles were white men, in their mid twenties to early forties, masculine presenting, or at least within the profiles and descriptions of themselves one reading
      "white daddy seeking masc for masc." In the morning, I walked across a park and around the city streets. At times I felt weary. Pondering what the other pedestrians were thinking of me. However, this kind of pondering is not exclusive to
      Boston. I am often concerned with my exterior sans location. Not so much my presentation (i.e. clothing), but my flesh.

      <br><br>My work is concerned with space. A conception of space where rings represent the different levels of space and place (see diagram 1). In the inner most ring is the body (the "mind" included), the next ring is your domestic place (your
      home, your room), the next ring is public place (office space, public restroom, school), and the next ring is civic place (town, city, side walk, park). Each of these expand and compress into one another, this is known because what happens to
      you in civic space can and most likely will affect your "body space." When aware that the body comes from two other bodies (parents) that have also had their own experiences within these rings, the rings eventually approach time, or in other
      words history. This conception of space is hacked when the body is specified. If someone's flesh is brown, how does that then affect their navigation of the rings. Furthermore, how do they feel about others who have their own rings to navigate
      who more or less do not look like you do. As I walked through the early streets of Boston, I was interacting with the rings of others, the rings of their parents, and the parents before them and so on. In this conception of space and place, I
      realize that my flesh is under not the eyes of the individual in front of me, but a much longer and historical gaze.

      <br><br>So perhaps then the white woman who crossed the street with her dog, saw what Hortense Spillers would call the "captive body." Spillers' "captive body" is what could be unavoidable, she states, "But this body, at least from the point of
      view of the captive community, focuses a private and particular space... the captive body becomes the source of irresistible, destructive sensuality, at the same time, the captive body reduces to a thing, becoming being for captor, in the
      absence from a subject position, the captured sexualities provide an expression of "otherness", as a category of "otherness" the captive body translates into sheer physical powerlessness (sic)." (Spillers 67).The woman may have crossed the
      street with her dog simply because she had to, and possibly did not even see me. The reasoning of her action is not the concern, the concern is my concern. My awareness of a specific gaze. My awareness that my flesh is, "that zero degree of
      social conceptualization that does not escape concealment under the brush of discourse, or the reflexes of iconography." (Spillers 67). My work addresses this concern, that breaches upon an understandable paranoia, through my obsessive use of
      brown. I address the surface, so I can get past it.

      <br><br>Yet, a larger mess emerges, where I question if the aesthetics of my work are meeting this paranoia head on, meaning in a way that is combative to the "white gaze" or I am simply defining myself to it. This mess leads me to a Cartesian
      puddle – a dark and murky one. In the puddle you can not clearly see whats in it, like that of a potion in a witch's cauldron. In the potion is a remedy, or better, an opportunity to emerge as a nothing at all, leaving room for self
      conceptualization. A notable example would be Audre Lorde's Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, a self-proclaimed "biomythography" that takes you through a highly illustrative telling of Lorde's life, including her childhood up to adulthood. I am
      attracted to "biomythography", like the rings in my conception of space, it is a style of writing that culminates the simultaneity of being, by incorporating multiple ways of expression, it reveals the complexity of identity, while keeping
      aware of something's or someone's origin. In the prologue of Zami Lorde writes, "I have felt the age-old triangle of mother father and child, with the "I" at its eternal core, elongate and flatten out into the elegantly strong triad of
      grandmother mother daughter, with the "I" moving back and forth flowing in either or both directions as needed." (Lorde 7). I attempt to signify the movement in Lorde's prologue, in relationship to my understanding of space and my practice.

      <br><br>My practice is personal, but thats not to say it is completely about me. However, I am frustrated. I am frustrated because it is a funny thing to make visual work about oneself, especially if the self that you are is not in a position
      of superiority. I have been told to think about something other than "race." I find solace in a passage of Baldwins' The Black Boy Looks at the White Boy, in it he claims, "...the really ghastly thing about trying to convey to a white man the
      reality of the Negro experience has nothing whatever to do with the fact of color, but has to do with this man's relationship to his own life. He will face in your life only what he is willing to face in his. Well, this means that one finds
      oneself tampering with the insides of a stranger, to no purpose, which one probably has no right to do..." (Baldwin 272). I work in abstraction because I want to see in an abstract sense; the pulled apartness, the flesh, the brown, the pink,
      the insides, the jeans, and the white t-shirt, coming together in an object. The body in my practice can shift, it is an object in the external, in civic space, and a space where actual home can be established. In Space and Place: The
      Perspective of Experience by Yi-Fu Tuan, Tuan defines "space" as, "...a common symbol of freedom in the Western world. Space lies open; it suggests the future and invites action. On the negative side, space and freedom are threat...To be open
      and free is to be exposed and vulnerable." (Tuan 54). I want to acknowledge this contradiction in my practice. The perhaps more invisible intent of my work posit itself in the form of a question - Is there space beyond the body for it to be
      free?

You went in many directions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your light did.
<br><br><br>
no focus or intention,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my intention –
<br><br><br>
is to feel you<br>
The way, The sun<br>
burns the skin.
<br><br><br>
I see your feet,<br>
pressing in the carpet.
<br><br><br>
I, I keep hearin' footsteps baby<br>
In the dark, in the dark
<br><br><br>
You’re here beside me.
<br><br><br>
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps baby<br>
In the dark, in the dark

Omg where do I begin. So many things are happening to me right now. Sooo many things. For one, I keep waking up at 3 a.m. I don’t know where I may have heard this, but 3 a.m. is a time when the veil between the living and the dead is pierced. The dead and the living are on the same plane essentially. I remember hearing this as a kid and it always frightened me, but now I don’t mind it because its not as if the spirit veil being pierced means that only bad spirits get through, the good come with the bad as well.<br><br>

But as I write this a little after 3 a.m. I keep noticing how my brain is having and has been having such a hard time staying on track with a single thought. I’m distracted by something in single second. Even right now, I keep stopping myself from writing to ponder a thought, an image in my brain, brought by something totally random. I even engage the thought a little. This could be something however that works in my benefit. I am someone who can engage in thought quite deeply. I see images though that cause me mental harm. I see death. I see bad things happening, but it’s all in my head. It is not a premonition. They are negative images coming forth through my anxiety, worry, and fear. What I feel like that same image driven brain can do though is write, it can manifest things. I could use to write the sketches, the scripts, or to write whatever the fuck I feel I must write and perform.<br><br>

I have come to understand that art is something where you must commit time to it. Everyday except Sunday, you should do something. No matter how big or small. Little tiny progressions into something, and the most important thing to remember is to not look back. Keep your head down and keep working, distractions will come. They will come in ways that will make them appear not as distractions, and when this happens where you are lead down a path to distraction land. Don’t freak out, let it happen, become aware of it, and then move on.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
